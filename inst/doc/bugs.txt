dmm_2.1-4	Bring version nos into line
		Fix gsummary() bug and NAMESPACE issues

dmm_2.1-3	In function gsummary() halts because variance.components
                item is not there in class specific case.
                Fixed in dmm_2.1-4

dmm_2.1-1       If VarE(I) ( or other components involving individual
                environmental effects) is made class specific dmm fails
                because it attempts to fit inestimble cross-class covariances.
                Fixed in dmm_2.1-2

dmm_1.5-1	In function mdf() the Sex coding column of the dataframe 'df' is
		passed to function makeS() of package 'nadiv' as a factor. This
		causes problems in makeS(). 
		Fix: mdf() modified in dmm_1.6-1 to pass either an integer 
                vector or a character vector as the 'sex' column of the
                'pedigree' 
		matrix passed to makeS().

dmm_1.6-1	In dataset sheep.df row 20 the Id 3a4127 is shown as a
                male (code "M")
		and later appears (on line 34) as a DId
		Fix: row 20 of sheep.df modified -> a female (code "F")
                in dmm_1.6-2.
		Note: This fix will affect the results shown for sheep.df
                analyses in dmmOverview.pdf. The document has been modified
                to reflect these changes.

dmm_1.6-4	Error in varz(), fails when first argument is NA, fixed
                in dmm_1.6-4
