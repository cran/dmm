Description: Mixed model analysis for quantitative genetics
  with multi-trait responses and pedigree-based partitioning 
  of individual variation into a range of environmental and 
  genetic variance components for individual and 
  maternal effects. Method documented in dmmOverview.pdf; dmm is an 
  implementation of dispersion mean model described by
  Searle et al. (1992) "Variance Components", Wiley, NY.
  'DMM' can do 'MINQUE', 'bias-corrected-ML', and 'REML'  variance component estimates.
